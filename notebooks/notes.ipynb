    "-  the **sensitivity** of a function is the largest possible difference that one row can have on the result of that function, for any dataset. Calculating the sensitivity for an arbitrary function is difficult\n",
    "- the larger the sensitivity S, the noisier the answer will be. Counting only has a sensitivity of 1, so we don’t need to add a lot of noise to preserve privacy\n",
    "- **epsilon** is the privacy loss of the mechanism\n",
    "- choosing a smaller epsilon produces noisier results and better privacy guarantees. As a reference, Apple uses an epsilon of 2 in their keyboard’s differentially-private auto-correct \n",
    "- To ensure a meaningful privacy guarantee, data curators can enforce a maximum privacy loss. If the number of queries exceeds the threshold, then the privacy guarantee becomes too weak and the curator stops answering queries. The maximum privacy loss is called the **privacy budget**. We can think of each query as a privacy ‘expense’ which incurs an incremental privacy loss. The strategy of using budgets, expenses and losses is fittingly known as privacy accounting \n",
    "- with increased queries, the privacy budget grows, and therefore the privacy guarantee is worse. In general, privacy losses accumulate, so when two answers are returned to an adversary, the total privacy loss is twice as large, and the privacy guarantee is half as strong. This cumulative property is a consequence of the composition theorem\n",
    "-  a randomized computation has **epsilon-differential privacy** if: the addition or removal of any one input record from any possible input dataset changes the probability the randomized computation produces any possible output by at most a factor of exp(epsilon)"
